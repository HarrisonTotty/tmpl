# Example Template Configuration File
# -----------------------------------

# (Optional)
# Specifies additional template configuration files to include, whose
# definitions will be merged into the main template configuration file. Note
# that this is a _shallow_ merge, so you can't use it to "extend" the
# "files" specification, for instance.
include:
  - "included.yaml"


# (Optional)
# Specifies python files from which to load additional Jinja functions.
lib:
  - "lib.py"


# Key-value pairs specified at the "base" of this file are accessible directly
# by name.
hello_message: "Hello, World!"


# (Required if STDIN not piped to script)
# Specifies the template files to be translated (or just copied) to the
# specified output directory.
files:
  # Let's translate the unit tests file.
  - dst: "unit-tests.out"
    src: "templates/unit-tests.in"

  # Let's copy over everything under the "files/images" directory without opening them
  # and attempting to parse them as Jinja templates.
  - dst: "files/images/*"
    translate: false

  # Let's copy over all ".txt" files under the "files/docs" directory without opening
  # them and attempting to parse them as Jinja templates.
  - dst: "files/docs/*.txt"
    translate: false
